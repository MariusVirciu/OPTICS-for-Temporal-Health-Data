# OPTICS-for-Temporal-Health-Data

The marriage of data science and epidemiology is of significance for the
advancement of public health research, but it remains a poorly explored area with a lot
more potential. This projectâ€™s aim is to provide aid to the researchers studying this sector by
developing a tool that processes geographical and temporal medical data. The proposed
product will be easy to use and streamline the process of clustering epidemiological data.
By offering an overview of the effect of both spatial and temporal dimensions, it will enable
researchers to better understand patterns and trends in how diseases spread.
The analysis of data through the lens of spatial and temporal data may reveal
insights and discoveries which could not be found through one of them alone. This tool will
not only aid in a deeper analysis of how diseases spread geographically and over time but
also provide data that may be used for cross reference with other types geo-spatial data
such as air quality of a region through time and population density, which will result in more
accurate data for further research and aid in the representation of less studied regions.
